# What (Really) Is Kubernetes?

That's such a silly question, isn't it? Everyone knows that Kubernetes is a container orchestrator.

What if Kubernetes is something else or, to be more precise, is much more than what many think it is?

This talk will try to demystify Kubernetes and show that it might not be (only) what people think it is. We'll go through the architecture and combine it with demos that will try to answer the "big question" that (almost) no one is asking.

I'll try to prove that Kubernetes is not what most of us think it is.
