# Unleashing the Power of Serverless Computing in Kubernetes with Knative, Crossplane, Dapr, KEDA, Shipwright, and Friends

## Description

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud native computing, serverless computing has emerged as a transformative force, offering a paradigm shift in application development and deployment. This talk delves into the world of serverless computing within the Kubernetes ecosystem, showcasing how open-source projects like Knative, Crossplane, Dapr, KEDA, Shipwright, and others empower developers to harness the power of serverless on top of Kubernetes.

This is a hands-on talk, where we will build a serverless application (including infrastructure) from scratch. We will then explore how to extend the application with additional serverless capabilities, such as eventing, messaging, and state management. We will also explore how to leverage the power of Kubernetes operators to extend the Kubernetes API with custom resources and controllers, and how to use these operators to provision and manage serverless applications.

## Benefits to the ecosystem

* Expanded Adoption of CNCF Technologies: Serverless computing on Kubernetes introduces new opportunities for developers to adopt and utilize CNCF projects like Knative, Crossplane, Dapr, Shipwright, and others. This broader adoption expands the reach of these technologies and strengthens the CNCF ecosystem.
* Enhanced Cloud-Native Development: Serverless architectures on Kubernetes provide a streamlined approach to cloud-native application development, enabling developers to focus on building code rather than managing infrastructure. This simplified development process contributes to the overall maturity and efficiency of cloud-native practices.
* Improved Portability and Interoperability: Serverless applications built on Kubernetes can be seamlessly deployed across different Kubernetes environments, regardless of the underlying cloud provider. This portability fosters greater interoperability and reduces vendor lock-in.
* Accelerated Innovation and Agility: Serverless computing on Kubernetes accelerates innovation and agility by abstracting away infrastructure management and enabling rapid deployment of applications. This agility empowers developers to quickly respond to changing requirements and market demands.
* Reduced Operational Overhead and Costs: Serverless architectures on Kubernetes eliminate the need for manual infrastructure provisioning and management, significantly reducing operational overhead and associated costs. This cost-efficiency benefits both developers and organizations.
* Enhanced Developer Productivity: Serverless computing on Kubernetes simplifies application development and deployment, freeing up developers to focus on writing high-quality code and innovative features. This increased productivity contributes to overall development efficiency.
* Expanded Application Use Cases: Serverless architectures on Kubernetes enable the development of a broader range of applications, including event-driven, microservices-based, and edge computing applications. This versatility expands the scope of cloud-native development.
* Stronger Community Collaboration: Serverless computing on Kubernetes brings together developers and infrastructure experts from different backgrounds, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the CNCF community. This collaboration contributes to the advancement of both serverless technologies and Kubernetes.
