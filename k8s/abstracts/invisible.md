# Shifting Left Kubernetes

Docker Swarm was user-friendly, so it saw huge (initial) adoption among developers. Nevertheless, it ultimately failed because it could not satisfy the needs of operators and sysadmins. Kubernetes, on the other hand, works well for operators, but fails to be user-friendly and easy for those who are focused on other tasks (e.g., developers, testers, etc.). Fortunately, Kubernetes was not designed to be the end-game. It is a platform to build platforms and that enables us to create solutions that could satisfy both groups.

In this session, we'll explore Shipa as a potential solution that can satisfy the needs of both developers and operators. It was designed to make it simpler for developers to run their applications in Kubernetes, while giving operators means to enable others and shift-left.
