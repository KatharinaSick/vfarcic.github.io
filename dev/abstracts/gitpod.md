# All That Developers Need Is a Browser (or How to Be More Productive by Having Less)

What would you say if I would tell you that you can be as productive with the cheapest laptop as with the one you already have? Would you believe me if I would say that there is no need for you to install an IDE, compilers, CLIs, Docker, and whatever else you might have on your laptop? How about having a full development environment created whenever you need it instead of dealing with virtual machines and whatever else might be fulfilling your development needs? What if I say that all you need is a browser and that it doesn't matter whether you have a laptop, desktop, Chromebook, or a tablet? On top of all that, I will even claim that you can be more productive without all those things.
