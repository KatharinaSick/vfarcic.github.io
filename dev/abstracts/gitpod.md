# All We Need Is a Browser

What would you say if I would tell you that you can be as productive with the cheapest laptop as with the one you already have? Would you believe me if I would say that there is no need for you to install an IDE, compilers, CLIs, Docker, and whatever else you might have on your laptop? How about having a full development environment created whenever you need it instead of dealing with virtual machines and whatever else might constitute your development needs? What if I say that all you need is a browser?

What I'm offering is to get everything we might need with a single click of a button and without anything installed, configured, or running on our laptops. If that did not spark interest, nothing will.
