# Crossplane Observability and Traceability for Effective Multi-Cloud Management

## Description

Companies adopting cloud-native technologies increasingly use declarative definitions of cloud infrastructure. This shift offers excellent scalability, flexibility and agility opportunities, but also comes with challenges: What if resource creation takes longer than expected? What if resources fail to materialize at all? How to identify problems and potential performance optimizations? The answer lies in a familiar strategy: as in software development, we can address these challenges through instrumentation and leveraging observability data to uncover patterns, pinpoint root causes, and drive informed optimizations. Join to learn how to answer those questions using existing metrics, logs and distributed traces emitted by tools like Crossplane, a popular open source CNCF project. The presenters will walk you through their best practices for making declarative cloud infrastructure traceable and leverage this data to improve issue resolution and your cloud infrastructure's reliability.
