# What The Heck Is Progressive Delivery?

Progressive delivery is a deployment practice that aims at rolling out new features gradually. It enforces the gradual release of a feature while, at the same time, tries to avoid any downtime. It is an **iterative approach to deployments**.

There you go. That's the definition. It is intentionally broad since progressive delivery encompasses quite a few practices, like **blue-green deployments, rolling updates, canary deployments**, and so on.

Still, many are confused about the differences, the applicability, and the requirements and benefits of each. Today we'll dismantle the myths and discuss each of the commonly used progressive delivery deployment mechanisms.
