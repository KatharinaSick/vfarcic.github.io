# Elevating SDLC through Platform Engineering

Title: "Elevating Software Development through Platform Engineering: Navigating the Lifecycle"

Abstract:

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, the synergy between the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) and Platform Engineering has emerged as a critical determinant of success. This talk explores the intricate relationship between these two domains, shedding light on how their collaboration can revolutionize the way we conceive, build, and maintain software systems.

We begin by delving into the fundamental principles of SDLC, emphasizing its stages, methodologies, and best practices. We unravel the nuances of Agile, Waterfall, and DevOps methodologies, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses in different contexts.

With a solid foundation in SDLC, we then transition into the world of Platform Engineering, a discipline dedicated to crafting internal developer platforms. We delve into the role of Platform Engineering in enabling continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD), and microservices architecture, demonstrating how it acts as an enabler for modern software development practices.

Furthermore, we explore the intricate interplay between SDLC and Platform Engineering, revealing how they complement and enhance each other.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

Attendees will leave with a comprehensive understanding of how a harmonious relationship between SDLC and Platform Engineering can elevate software development to new heights. Armed with practical insights, they will be better equipped to make informed decisions, optimize their development processes, and drive innovation within their organizations.
