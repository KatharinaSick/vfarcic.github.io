# Talk: The Objectives And The Principles Behind GitOps

## Abstract

GitOps is nothing new. Or, to be more precise, the principles of GitOps existed long before the term was invented. But hey, that's the pattern in our industry. It is the fate of all good practices to be misunderstood, so we need to come up with new names to get people back on track. That is not to say that we are in a constant loop. Instead, I tend to think of it as a periodic reset trying to eliminate misinterpretations. GitOps is one of those resets. It fosters the practices and the ideas that existed for a while now and builds on top of them.

We'll explore the fundamental principles of GitOps and the outcomes of those principles. We also try to answer some fundamental questions like "why do we want GitOps?", "why isn't everyone using GitOps?", and whether GitOps is mature enough for everyone to adopt it.
