# How to Implement a Secure GitOps Workflow

## Abstract

Tired of slides? Watch this hands-on demo with Viktor Farcic to see how to create a full lifecycle of applications in production using the GitOps. See how a GitOps workflow is ideal for high-security environments and establishing auditing trails and how it might change the way we define application lifecycle pipelines.

Weâ€™ll see how to combine security scanning with Snyk, remove cluster access through GitOps implemented with Argo CD, and combine it all through continuous delivery (CD) pipelines in Argo Workflows.
