# Talk: Applying GitOps To Continuous Delivery

## Abstract

GitOps is all the rage. Yet, it is still difficult to "inject" its principles into continuous delivery pipelines and make it part of a fully automated application lifecycle.

We'll explore the fundamental principles of GitOps and the outcomes of those principles. We try to demonstrate how they can be added to the existing continuous delivery pipelines, and the benefits that brings.

Through a hands-on demo, we'll explore a full lifecycle of applications in production. We'll use Terraform to create and manage a Kubernetes cluster and Argo CD to deploy applications. We'll rely on Codefresh to run pipelines that will tie those and other tools together.
