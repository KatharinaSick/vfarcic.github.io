# Applying GitOps And Continuous Delivery (CD) On Infrastructure Using Terraform And Codefresh

There are many articles and videos about practicing Continuous Delivery (CD) with applications, but not nearly as many for infrastructure. The same can be said for GitOps. Everyone talks about applications, and most are missing infrastructure. That is a bit strange given that applications and infrastructure are almost the same today. Both are defined as code, and everyone stores code in Git repositories. Hence, GitOps is just as good of a fit for infrastructure as for anything else. Since, today, infrastructure is defined as code, there is no reason not to use "good" coding practices. So, making pull requests, validating suggested changes, and applying continuous delivery processes makes just as much sense for infrastructure as for applications.

With that in mind, we'll explore how to combine Continuous Delivery (CD) with GitOps and apply the processes on infrastructure. We'll use Terraform as a way to define and apply infrastructure resources and [Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/) to run CD pipelines. Specifically, we'll go through a hands-on demo of creating, modifying, and destroying a cluster and all the associated resources, without clicking any buttons.
