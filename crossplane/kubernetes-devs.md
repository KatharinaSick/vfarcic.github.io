# Kubernetes

* Ops love it
* Devs?


# Kubernetes

* It's too complicated
* It's too low-level


## What if someone else
# manages everything?

* Not in control
* Reactive


## What if devs
# manage everything?

* Deployment, StatefulSet, KNative, ...?
* Scaling?
* Storage? Networking? Security?
* etc.


## What if we use a
# highly opinionated
## solution?

* Not flexible
* Needs to be 100% of what we need


# What devs need?

* Kubernetes?
* Cloud?
* Stop everything and learn everything?
* Write code, build, test, and deploy apps


# What devs need?

* Define infrastructure, **NOT** building blocks
* Define applications, **NOT** k8s resources


# What ops need?

* Cloud
* Kubernetes
* Building blocks


# Kubernetes and Cloud...

* All we need to run systems at scale


# Ops need to...

* Empower devs to own infra and applications
* Enable devs by providing services


# Kubernetes and Cloud...

* Necessary to some and a burden to others
* Can we satisfy all?
* Based on k8s yet easy to operate?


# Kubernetes and Cloud...

* Disappear
* Implementation detail
* Running in the background


# We need...

* Tools that enable ops to create services for devs
