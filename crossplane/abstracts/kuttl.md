# Dive into Kubernetes Testing Techniques with KUTTL and Crossplane

In the ever-evolving landscape of container orchestration and microservices, Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard. As Kubernetes adoption continues to skyrocket, ensuring the reliability and correctness of your Kubernetes manifests becomes paramount. Enter KUTTL (Kubernetes Test TooL), a powerful and versatile testing framework designed specifically for Kubernetes manifest testing.

This talk will provide a comprehensive exploration of KUTTL and its role in simplifying the validation and testing of Kubernetes manifests. We will delve into the essential concepts of Kubernetes testing, discussing why it is crucial in modern application deployment pipelines and how KUTTL facilitates this process.

Crossplane Compositions will be used as examples of Kubernetes manifests, and we will demonstrate how to use KUTTL to test them. We will also explore how to integrate KUTTL into your CI/CD pipelines to ensure that Crossplane Configurations are always tested before being published to the marketplace.
