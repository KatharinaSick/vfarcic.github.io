# Using Kubernetes API To Manage Everything

If we would have to define the bigger benefit Kubernetes provides, that would not be the ability to run containers, fault-tollerance, or immutability. The main benefit is it's API. It is well defined, versatile, and extensible. It might be the main culprit behind the "explosion" of the ecosystem created around Kubernetes.

Can we take Kubernetes API to the next level? Can we use it to manage not only the workloads running inside Kubernetes clusters, but for everything else? Wouldn't it be beneficial if we would have a **single API** and a **universal control plane** responsible for management of applications, infrastructure, services, and everything else, no matter whether we are in public cloud and on-prem?

In this hands-on session, we'll explore the principles behind the **universal control plane** implemented through the open source project **Crossplane**.
