# The Future Of Declarative Infrastructure

The tools for managing infrastructure and services have come a long way since their inception. We evolved from CFEngine to Chef and Puppet, and, later on, Ansible. We switched from a mostly mutable to a mostly immutable approach with Terraform and Pulumi. What's next? Where are we going from here?

In this talk, we'll go through the history of the tools used to manage infrastructure and the principles behind them them. They goal is to understand how we got where we are today and what the future holds for us. We'll also look at the current state of the art and the problems that we're facing today. Finally, we'll look at the future of declarative infrastructure and what we can expect from it.



The rapidly evolving landscape of modern computing has paved the way for groundbreaking innovations in the realm of infrastructure management. Declarative Infrastructure, a paradigm that emphasizes specifying "what" state the infrastructure should be in rather than "how" to achieve that state, has emerged as a powerful approach to handle the complexities of managing distributed systems. This talks explores the future of declarative infrastructure, examining its advancements, challenges, and the plethora of opportunities it presents.

Advancements in declarative infrastructure have been driven by advancements in cloud computing, containerization, and orchestration technologies. The adoption of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices has significantly accelerated, allowing developers and operators to treat infrastructure as a versioned, reproducible, and scalable resource. The integration of declarative approaches with modern Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines has enabled organizations to build, deploy, and manage complex infrastructures with unprecedented speed and efficiency.

Despite its promises, the declarative infrastructure faces several challenges. As systems grow in size and complexity, ensuring consistency, compliance, and security across diverse infrastructures becomes a critical concern. Furthermore, achieving real-time reactivity and resilience in highly dynamic environments remains a significant challenge for existing declarative frameworks.

In this context, the talk also sheds light on the emerging technologies and methodologies that can shape the future of declarative infrastructure. Concepts like GitOps, which enforces infrastructure state through version control systems, offer a potential solution to managing large-scale, distributed systems more effectively. Additionally, the rise in the adoption of Kubernetes holds great promise and might shed some light on what we might expect from the tools that manage infrastructure.

In this talk, we'll take a look at the past, the history, the present, and the future of the tools used to manage infrastructure, and everything else.
