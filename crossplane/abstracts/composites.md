# Empowering Developers To Manage Infrastructure

Shifting left is the holy grail of software development. We want developers to be autonomous, but we are faced with a considerable challenge. How can developers be independent without knowing everything about everything? We cannot expect everyone to possess deep knowledge about infrastructure, security, networking, architecture, etc.

The only way to create autonomous teams is to generate opinionated frameworks and allow developers to focus only on what matters to them, while everything else is below abstractions. For such an approach to work, opinionated frameworks cannot be created by software vendors. Instead, we need tools that will allow "specialists" to develop services that developers can consume. We need a way for you to define opinions easily consumed by developers without taking away their autonomy.

In this session, we will explore how DevOps engineers, operators, administrators, and sysadmins can create **Crossplane Compositions** that will allow anyone, no matter their experience, to manage the infrastructure while still applying all the (often complicated) rules and policies. We'll see how you can enable developers to manage infrastructure and services.
