# How To Fight Misconfiguration And Bad Intentions

Sometimes we make mistakes unintentionally while, at other times, bad actors try to exploit our systems. No matter the reason, misconfigurations can lead to security breaches, data loss, or even bring the whole system down. We may never be able to prevent all of these, but we can certainly minimize the risk by applying policies to infrastructure, services, and applications. The primary weapon in this fight is Policy-as-Code tools combined with Internal Developer Platforms.

In this talk, we'll build an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) and combine it with policies. As a result, we will not only enable developers to define and manage their applications and infrastructure, but we will also ensure that they are "doing the right thing" by guiding them with policies.

We'll use Crossplane to build an IDP that will allow developers to define their infrastructure and applications. We'll also use Datree to define policies that will guide them to define the resources they need, help them avoid making mistakes, and ensure that even malicious actors won't be able to exploit the system.

## Benefits To The Ecosystem

* Platform Engineers will be able to design the platform in a way that will allow developers to define their infrastructure and applications in a simple and consistent way.
* Developers will be able to define their infrastructure and applications in a simple and consistent way.
* Developers will be able to define policies that will guide them to define the resources they need, help them avoid making mistakes, and ensure that even malicious actors won't be able to exploit the system.
