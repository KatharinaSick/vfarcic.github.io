# Platform Engineering and Crossplane: A New Era of Cloud Management

In the past, platform engineering was focused on providing a stable and reliable platform for developers to build on. Today, platform engineering is evolving to include the management of cloud resources and services. Crossplane is a new open-source tool that is helping to shape the future of platform engineering.

Crossplane is a cloud-native control plane that enables platform engineers to manage Kubernetes and other cloud resources in a consistent and declarative way. It makes it easy to create, update, and delete resources across multiple clouds and providers. It also provides a powerful way to automate the management of complex cloud deployments. More importantly, Crossplane composition enables us to create new interfaces (CRDs and controllers) that can be used to define groups of resources at the right level of abstraction.

This is a hands-on demo session.
