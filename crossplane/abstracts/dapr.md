# Provisioning and Consuming Multi-Cloud Infrastructure with Crossplane and Dapr

How can we enable development teams to connect microservices without worrying about the available infrastructure? Can we enable them with all the tools that they need to focus on their services instead of understanding the details of rest of the system?

In this presentation we will be covering the story of two development teams and a platform team who is in charge of enabling these teams with all the tools and infrastructure that they need. 
We will be using Dapr, Crossplane and Redis (as a database and an event store) in a live demo where we will show these tools in action and the abstractions needed by these teams to deliver software efficiently.
