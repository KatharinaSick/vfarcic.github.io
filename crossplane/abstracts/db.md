# Databases Belong to Apps and Apps Belong to Git

Databases serve as the data store for applications, yet, we often separate them from the application lifecycle. This separation makes it difficult to manage the lifecycle of the application and the database together. It also makes it difficult to manage the lifecycle of the database itself.

Can we unify application and database lifecycle management and put them into the hands of the developers? Can we create a system through which DBA experience is codified and served as a service?

In this session, we'll explore how we can combine GitOps with Argo CD, Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions through Crossplane, and schema management with Atlas to create a system that will allow developers to define and manage their applications and databases in a simple and consistent way.
