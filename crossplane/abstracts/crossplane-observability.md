# From Kubernetes Out Of Kubernetes Observability

Now that the industry is moving towards extending Kubernetes to manage more and more of the infrastructure, services, and applications running outside Kubernetes itself, it is becoming obvious that we need to have a holistic view of the entire system. We need control planes that will provide not only management but also observability to the whole system.

This talk will discuss the concepts of control planes and data planes, and how they are used to manage the lifecycle of infrastructure, applications, and services, and how we can apply observability to such resources.

Through a practical demo, we'll see how we can combine Crossplane's ability to manage any type of resources with Kubernetes events,Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and a few other tools to provide a holistic view of the entire system.
