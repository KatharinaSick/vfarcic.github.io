# The Only Thing That Matters In DevOps Is...

DevOps engineers tend to be obsessed with their favorite tools and platforms. That could be Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, Grafana, Crossplane, or any other among a myriad of those labeled as "DevOps". However, that is often missing the point of what we're trying to accomplish. The goal should be to enable everyone to be in complete control of their applications, including dependent services and infrastructure. DevOps is about having self-sufficient teams, and the only way to accomplish that is by providing services that everyone can consume. Instead of waiting for requests to create a cluster, perform security scanning, deploy an application, and so on, ops and other specialized teams should be enabling others to do those operations. That enablement is best accomplished by creating an Internal Developer Platform (IDP).

This session will explore the architecture and the critical ingredients needed for an IDP. We'll also discuss the key benefits of an IDP, and we'll see, through a demo, how we could build one.

We'll combine tools like Backstage, Argo CD, Crossplane, and quite a few others into a platform that everyone can use, no matter their experience level.

##Â Benefit the ecosystem?

This presentation covers a set of tools inside the CNCF ecosystem (Backstage, Argo CD, Crossplane, etc.) that can be used to build a custom Internal Developer Platform (IDP).
